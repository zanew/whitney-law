            Have you made your will yet? If you havenâ€™t, or it has been
            several years since, we are here to review your situation
            with you and help you make an estate plan that is right for
            you. Enjoy the peace of mind that comes from knowing your
            wills and trusts are clear, easy to follow, and ready to
            accomplish your goals. And if someone has passed on leaving
            an estate to settle, whether with a will or without, we are
            ready to open a probate administration promptly and proceed
            towards formal distribution with an eye on eliminating
            possible disputes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let us handle your probate case as we have successfully done
            for so many others. Probate administration can often become
            complicated with issues of inheritance of estate taxes,
            missing heirs, minors, nursing home liens, creditors,
            out-of-state assets, etc. We can mange these issues and more
            so you can avoid the stress. And if someone you know has
            lost the ability to manage their own finances or care for
            themselves, we are always available to assist in obtaining a
            guardianship form the court which w ill permit you or
            another to take over.
